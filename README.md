## Program Descriptions<a name="des"></a>
This 3-months duration program provides foundational data skills that apply across 
functions and industries. It focuses on analyzing data and 
building models with Excel, query databases using SQL, 
and creating informative data visualizations with Tableau. 

## Part 1: Problem Solving with Analytics<a name="p1"></a>

### Project 1.1: Predicting Diamond Prices
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a set of 3,000 diamonds, 
but is unsure how much it should bid. So, I applied a 
linear regression model to predict the diamond prices and 
make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

### Project 1.2: Predicting Catalog Demand
A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits 
from sending a catalog to 250 new customers. So, I applied a framework to work 
through the problem and built a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.

## Part 2: Data Wrangling<a name="p2"></a>

### Project 2.1: Create an Analytical Dataset
A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. 
So, I used data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset, 
then build a predictive model to select the best location.

### Project 2.2: Create Reports from a Database
Create Reports from a Database Management wants some high level metrics 
about their organization. I wrote SQL queries to extract and analyze 
data from a transactions database and prepared a set of visualizations.


## Part 3: Data Visualization<a name="p3"></a>

### Project 3: Visualizing Movie Data
In this project, I explored a movies dataset and built Tableau dashboards 
to answer a set of questions, listed below, and tell a story with data.
- Question 1: How have movie genres changed over time?
- Question 2: How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures?
- Question 3: How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not based on novels?
- Question 4: What is the most profitable runtime for a movie?

## Part 4: Classification Models<a name="p4"></a>

### Project 4: Predicting Customer's Creditworthiness
A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. 
So, I built and applied a classification model to provide a recommendation 
on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.


## Part 5: A/B Testing<a name="p5"></a>

### Project 5: Analyzing a Market Test
A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. 
So, I designed and analyzed an A/B test and wrote up a 
recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.


## Part 6: Time Series Forecasting<a name="p6"></a>

### Project 6: Forecast Video Game Sales
A video game producer is planning production levels. 
So, I used time series forecasting models to forecast monthly 
demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand.


## Part 7: Segmentation and Clustering<a name="p7"></a>

### Project 7: Predictive Analytics Capstone
A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. 
You will use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations 
on how to expand. After completing the project, you will feel comfortable 
combining predictive techniques and delivering results to complex business problems.
